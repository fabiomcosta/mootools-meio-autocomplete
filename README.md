Note
----

1.x and below are the versions made to be used with Mootools 1.2.x.
2.x and greater are the versions made to be used with Mootools 1.3.x or greater.

Introduction
------------

Thats not just another autocomplete plugin.
I made it because i needed it to work like a dom select element and because i wanted it to be flexible in a way that i could use anything as the autocomplete list.
This plugin can also share the same list element, in a way that it will inject just one dom element on the document if you create more than one autocomplete instance in the same page.

How to use
----------

This example shows most of its this plugin's options. All the values are the default ones.

    #JS
    var data = [
        {"value": 0, "text": "Brazil"},
        {"value": 1, "text": "Ajax"},
    ];

    var autocomplete = new Meio.Autocomplete(
        $('text_input_id'),
        data, // can be an array
              // or an url (a JSON request will be created
              // or a function that should provide the data (see examples inside the documentation)
        {
            delay: 200,             // The delay before rendering the list of options. Usefull when you are using the autocomplete with ajax
            minChars: 0,            // The minimum number of characters the user has to input before the list of options to select is shown.
            cacheLength: 20,        // The cache length. Cache will decrease the number of ajax calls. Each time you make a different query it will be cached locally.
            cacheType: 'shared',    // 'shared' or 'own'. The cache instance can be shared with other Meio.Autocomplete instances or this instance can have its own cache.
            selectOnTab: true,      // If the user press the 'tab' key, the current focused option will be selected.
            autoFocus: true,        // Auto focus if there is only one option. Also selects this one option if element is not active (user moved to other field while request running).
            maxVisibleItems: 10,    // Defines the height of the list. If its 10 the list will have its height adjusted to show 10 options, but you can scroll to the other of course.

            onItemToList: function(elements){},      // this event is fired when theres an option to list
            onNoItemToList: function(elements){},    // this event is fired when theres no option to list
            onSelect: function(elements, value){},   // this event is fired when you select an option
            onDeselect: function(elements){},        // this event is fired when you deselect an option

            filter: {
                /*
                    its posible to pass the filters directly or by passing a type and optionaly a path.

                    filter: function(text, data){}            // filters the data array
                    formatMatch: function(text, data, i){}    // this function should return the text value of the data element
                    formatItem: function(text, data){}        // the return of this function will be applied to the 'html' of the li's

                    or

                    type: 'startswith' or 'contains' // can be any defined on the Meio.Autocomplete.Filter object
                    path: 'a.b.c' // path to the text value on each object thats contained on the data array
                */
            },

            fieldOptions: {
                classes: {
                    loading: 'ma-loading',    // applied to the field when theres an ajax call being made
                    selected: 'ma-selected'   // applied to the field when theres a selected value
                }
            },
            listOptions: {
                width: 'field',     // you can pass any other value settable by set('width') to the list container
                container: 'body', // CSS selector representing the element that the list is going to be inserted
                classes: {
                    container: 'ma-container',
                    hover: 'ma-hover',        // applied to the focused options
                    odd: 'ma-odd',            // applied to the odd li's
                    even: 'ma-even'           // applied to the even li's
                }
            },
            requestOptions: {
                formatResponse: function(jsonResponse){ // this function should return the array of autocomplete data from your jsonResponse
                    return jsonResponse;
                },
                noCache: true,    // nocache is setted by default to avoid cache problem on ie
                // you can pass any of the Request.JSON options here -> http://mootools.net/docs/core/Request/Request.JSON
            },
            urlOptions: {
                queryVarName: 'q',  // the name of the variable that's going to the server with the query value inputed by the user.
                extraParams: null,  // you can pass an array of elements or objects with 'value' and 'name' keys. the value key can 'value' can be a function.
                                    // ex: if you pass [{'name': 'x', 'value': function(){ return 2; }}] the url generated to get the list of options will have the 'x' parameter with value '2'.
                max: 20             // the max number of options that should be listed. This will be sent to the ajax request as the 'limit' parameter.
            }
        },
        listInstance   // The instance of the list. Passing a Meio.Autocomplete.List will allow you to have just one list DOM element, saving resources on a heavy page.
    );
