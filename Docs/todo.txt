TODO:

* OK New structure im thinking about: OK
  Meio.Widget should be a class for a widget that contains references to 'n' instances of the Meio.Element class.
  Meio.Autocomplete should extend Meio.Widget.
  Both the Input and the List will extend the Meio.Element Class.
* FIXED BUG, sometimes you cant focus an option using the keyboard
* FIXED cache option should be an integer that determines the number of url+inputedText to cache
* FIXED make it auto-scrollable
* FIXED improve code for determining the height of a li.
* FIXED make it work with a json formatted response
* FIXED delay should be 'cleared' when you input another char
* FIXED BUG special chars (like 'á') don't fire the update function because it doenst fire the keydown nor keypress event.
  Maybe on a Portuguese layout it does but not on an english one. Use keyup to fix this issue.
* FIXED apply a class when the json is loading and remove it when its done
* FIXED the URL is being evaluated twice as necessary, avoid this
* FIXED if the input element is not focused the options should not show
* FIXED BUG if I select the text from the input and press the right or left arrow it will understand that theres no value at the input.
  Fix this at the getElementKeyDownValue function.
* FIXED should have a reset function to reset everything like the cached url and the cache (flushCache)
* FIXED should have a function to remove the events that are applied to it
* FIXED remove listNumber if its just needed for toggleVisibility
* FIXED automatically take care of special chars that are equivalent to ascII chars. Like it you input 'á', words with 'a' should appear too.
  It will be optional. (This is something that should be done into the filter function. Just make some examples with the diff cases).
* INVALID (if you dont need a filter just set it as a $lambda(true) function) check the need to filter even when the data is a request data
* FEATURE you can pass an element as an extra parameter (extraParam) as long as it has a name and a value property (input elements for example).
* FIXED option to select on tab key pressed
* FIXED (just set this into the onSelectItem event) should synchronize its value with anything (hidden input for example).
* FEATURE create pre-defined filters to make it easyer for users to start using it ('contains' and 'startswith')
* FIXED BUG when you tab elements with autocomplete quickly it doesnt the list doenst gets hidden.
* FIXED prepare list when you paste a text into the input (paste event), Paste event should be detected
* FIXED pay attention, it should synchronize the value before the form is submitted, no matter what.
* INVALID (the programer will have to do it on server-side. I won't make an ajax request just for this little thing, of course ill include examples talking about this) analyze what to do in cases that the input comes with value setted. What should it do? I need to know if the value is setted or not.
* FIXED when you press enter it should prevent default just when the list is showing.
* FIXED the list should be scrollable (show scroll);
* FIXED test value to enable " and other stuff, just convert some chars to html encoded;
* FIXED (all you need is css) test the various width options, including if you wish to make it scrollable horizontally;
* FIXED the update event is still being called when its not needed.
  It should just be called when the value of the input changes.
  This is happening because the old value is not being controlled correctly;
* FIXED the onUnselectItem event should not fire when the input value havent changed (and maybe it should be onDeselectItem);
* FIXED BUG mousedown was being added 2 times on the same list and is throwing error at some point.
* BUG write 'ajax' and remove the 'jax'. It will not render the list correct sometimes.
* INVALID (impossible to implement) options to sync at start, that will be disabled by default;
* ?? (dont know why i wrote this, but ill keep cause maybe ill remember someday) find a way to cache properly the values when they come from an array.
* FEATURE create a cacheType option that can be set to:
  'own': each instance will have its own cache;
  'shared': all the autocomplete instances of the page will share the same cache; (default)
* OK make it scalable. It means that it should add minimun events and DOM els if i add more than one Autocomplete on the same page.
  Things to consider: keyPressControl, cache, list DOM element and its events.
* INVALID (if someone asks for it maybe i can do it but i dont want this into the plugin) allow effects to be used with the list
* OK adapt it in a way that it could be used without being just an autocomplete. It could be used to create a dynamic list for a search for example.
  Would be awezomm!
* fix the problem with select and flash overlay (ie6);


* make it work exactly like a select. It will have an options that will receive a selector for a hidden input field.
  With this option, i would be able to synchronize the value of the input text onload, by sending an ajax request to the server ondomready
  containing the id of the hidden field. Thats a proposal, lets see if this is possible while coding.
* include examples talking about the value synchronization (a very often case);
* the list should be possible to be anything, like a table for example.
* make it possible to enter multiple values
* test if the browser has max-height, if it does use it instead of calculating it.
* make it work on the iphone in a usable way



Miscelaneous thoughts:

interesting article about accent folding:

initial synchronize
---------------------
With 'initial synchronize' i mean that the sync fields and the autocomplete field would have theyr values synced when the page loads.

I was trying to make the initial synchronize feature but i think its costly and error-prone enought to be discarded. It should be done server-side.

Meio.Autocomplete plugin main goals:

* Should be able to synchronize safely any value with something, like the value of a hidden input with a passed value;

It should be able to get the String value corresponding to this dependent value when it is still setted at the initialization,
Like when your on a edit page (if the current text input is empty).

* Should be capable of using ajax or using a local passed array;
* Should handle safely mouse and keyboard events;
* Should have easily customizable styles;
* Should be easy to make the results dependent on another input values;
* Should be optimized to have more than one instance on one page.
